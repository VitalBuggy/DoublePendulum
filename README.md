# Simulating a Double Pendulum

For the last few projects I have done, I have used raylib quite a bit. This is in order to sort of prepare myself for OpenGL. Since this project's core is more based around physics and the math isn't that hard to implement in code. This is going to be a way of me improving my knowledge of more abstract concepts in graphical programming, rather than implementing physics into code and my understanding of physics in general.

## Physics

To get the boring stuff out of the way first, the movement of a double pendulum is governed by these two equations

where _Î¸_ is the angle of the bearing on each rod, meaning that _Î¸'_ is the angular velocity (first time derivative of position) and _Î¸"_ is the angular acceleration (second time derivative of position).

The given equations are used to calculate the angular accelerations of the masses as a function of the angular velocities, masses and lengths of the rods.

These 2 equations can be derived using the Lagrangian method or purely with the Newtonian physics way, both of which would lead to the same result, however one being less laborious than the other _(Lagrangian_ ðŸ˜€ _)_...
